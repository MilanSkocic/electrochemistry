\section{Conclusion} 

The weighting terms for the numerical fitting procedure were defined using 
the definition of the $\chi ^2$ distribution and a scaling factor for the covariance matrix.
The latter correctly reflected the noise of the experimental data in the computed 
i.e. the covariance matrix will correctly estimate the confidence intervals 
for the fitted parameters. 

Moreover, the confidence intervals were helpful for determining the number of 
semiconductive contributions. The estimation of the confidence intervals can 
be used as a break point of the iterative search when the intervals of two 
contributions are overlapping i.e. they are no more statistically discernable. 

Experimental spectra were tested with up to 12 contributions over 3 different 
potentials and the estimated confidence intervals were helpfull at asserting 
that the semiconductive contributions are statistically discernable.
